Outputting elements of the vector:
Vector 1 (created using the default constructor): []
Vector 2 (created using data from input.txt): [126923 9524 5 0 -156 ]

Filling vector 1 with data from the input.txt but data coming in Vector 1 directly:
[-194 1247 0 5 12950 ]

Example of the prefix-decrement operation on Vector 2:
[126922 9523 4 -1 -157 ]

Example of assignment operation with copying:
Vector 3 (copied from Vector 1): [-194 1247 0 5 12950 ]

Example of assignment operation with moving:
Vector 4 (moved from Vector 2): [126922 9523 4 -1 -157 ]
Vector 2 after move: []
