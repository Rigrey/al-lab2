Outputting elements of the vector:
Vector 1 (created using the default constructor): []
Vector 2 (created using data from input.txt): [1 0 0 1 1 ]

Filling vector 1 with data from the input.txt but data coming in Vector 1 directly:
[0 0 1 1 0 ]

Example of the XOR (^) operation:
Vector 1 XOR Vector 2: [1 0 1 0 1 ]

Example of assignment operation with copying:
Vector 4 (copied from Vector 2): [1 0 0 1 1 ]

Example of assignment operation with moving:
Vector 5 (moved from Vector 2): [1 0 0 1 1 ]
Vector 2 after move: []
